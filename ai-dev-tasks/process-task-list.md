Goal: Execute the task list sequentially, one task at a time.

Process:
- Start at task 1.1 unless I specify otherwise.
- For each task:
  1) Restate the task.
  2) Make the minimal code changes.
  3) Show a unified DIFF of all modified files.
  4) Wait for my approval before continuing.
- If tests are part of the task, add/update tests and run them; report pass/fail.
- If acceptance criteria arenâ€™t met, ask for guidance before moving on.
- Never skip tasks or reorder without approval.
